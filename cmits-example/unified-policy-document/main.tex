% This file is the backbone of a CMITS policy document: it includes the
% chapters, it sets out organization-specific definitions, and it
% pulls in the magic that makes it a CMITS document.
%
% Things that are input or included come from files in the TEXINPUTS path,
% which will point to directories named in make_config.ini. Look in those
% directories.

% One side, because this document is unlikely ever to be printed on paper,
% and when you're looking at it in a PDF viewer, odd pages are below even
% pages, not beside them, so twoside pages seem to alternate back and
% forth for no reason.
