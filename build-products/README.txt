-----------------

This is the unified policy document built from the CMITS example policy. It
collects all of the human-written documentation (in the example policy, there
isn't much of this), the Puppet manifest with its embedded documentation, and
auto-summaries into one document suitable for saving in a fireproof box or
handing to an auditor.
